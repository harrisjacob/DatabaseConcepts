<h1>Stage 2 Details:</h1>
<p>
<div>We plan on using the LAMP server provided to us by Dr. Weninger. However, we will use Python to do most of the heavy lifting in the backend instead of PHP. Python already runs on db.cse.nd.edu so we will not have to install it. The front end will primarily use HTML and CSS for navigation and style.</div>
<br>
<div>We get our data directly from Notre Dame Football through the Sports Analytics program. The data is given to us in the form of a .csv file. In the interest of security, the names of certain attributes (Play, Formation, Coverage, Blitz, etc.) are replaced with randomly generated 3 word strings from Python’s namegenerator library. These replacements correspond one to one to the values they are replacing. For instance the play name “13 BUBBLE ZIP GOLD” would be replaced with the same string everywhere it appears in the play attribute. <div>
