# NDFootball Defensive Database

In this project, we constructed a database system and web client to improve how Notre Dame football scouts opposing defenses. We do so by allowing for the easy upload of scouting data and then use various database queries to easily access and display important data that otherwise would have taken hours to curate by hand using the previous system.

This project will cut down on the amount of scouting work that Notre Dame Football Analytics group will do on a weekly basis. The reports that are generated usually are manually created by the data analytics group through a combination of XOS Thunder (a football video and statistics software) and Microsoft Excel which takes hours each week. The defensive coverage prediction function positions Notre Dame to be on the forefront of in-game analytics, which are slowly being adapted in college football after widespread use in the NFL.
